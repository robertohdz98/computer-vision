# Table of contents

**1. img-processing**. This assignment focuses on image processing and object detection with an input video as a starting point using OpenCV.

*Basic concepts:* 
- Basic image processing: Gaussian and bilateral filters, RGB/HSV color spaces, morphological operations
- Object detection: Sobel edges detector, Hough transform for circles detection, grayscale likelihood map, pre-trained model for eye detection
- Object tracking

<br/>

**2. face-classification**. This assignment focuses on exploring more advanced techniques for constructing features that better describe objects of interest and also on performing face recognition using these features.

*Basic concepts:* 
- Feature representations using handcrafted (HOG and SIFT feature descriptors) and non-handcrafted techniques
- Principal-Component Analysis (PCA): eigenfaces in face detection context
- Multi-class classification of images using already built feature representations

<br/>

**3. dl-classification-segmentation**. This assignment consists of using deep learning for three main tasks: image classification, semantic segmentation and adversarial attacks.

*Basic concepts:* 
- Image classification: CNN to recognise 20 classes
- Semantic segmentation
- Adversarial attacks
